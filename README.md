# DA3_SQL_Project
SQL project for ThePower MBA DA master

The steps taken for this project went as follows:

* I reorganized the schema/diagram in a way which was **visually appealing** to me, ensuring no lines crossed their paths.
* I tackled the first queries as I went through the recorded classes and learning material.
* Once I arrived to the 38 query approx, I reviewed the recorded classes and looked online for tutoriasls/help.

Additionally, I tried to find different solutions to the class exercises, and used them to find solutions to project exercises
I did not understand.

There is not much to be said about steps or structure followed here, I just did what I could whenever I could, as my free time is extremely limited.

##Tools used:
* DBeaver
* Github desktop
* VSC 
* Gemini 3 pro

I want to clarify the use of AI was, **in no way, shape, or form, to complete any query or exercise for me**, I used Gemini to solve doubts,  
such as which was the effective difference between tackling certain queries with joins or subqueries.

This way is how I understood that un DDBB like Sakila, it doesn't really matter due to the small amount of data, whether we use joins or subqueries,  
but in real life DDBB, with lots of data, joins are usually more effective than subqueries, while subqueries are usually easier to read.

##Analysis result:
The only oddities I have noticed is that Sakila is a pretty small DDBB, and that it has empty/NULL columns.
